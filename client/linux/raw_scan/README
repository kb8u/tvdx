See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

This is a program to continuously scan all channels on your SiliconDust
HDHomerun device on "/tuner0/".  The results are sent to
https://rabbitears.info/all_tuners where maps are available to show what
TV transmitters were detected by all participants.  You must email
webmaster@rabbitears.info with your tuner ID, a description for the map, and
latitude and longitude so that the site will accept your data and show your
location.

The script that does the scanning is normally installed to
~/tvdx/scan_tuner.pl  Also, a cron job has been configured so that the program
starts automatically after installation and after each computer restart.

You can either reboot your computer to start it, or open a terminal window
and run the command `~/tvdx/scan_tuner.pl &`

If you want to use /tuner0/ for other purposes, you will need to stop the
cron job.  Run `pkill -QUIT -f scan_tuner.pl` to stop it.  It may take a minute
or two for the tuner to actually become available after the program is stopped.
You can power-cycle the tuner if you don't want to wait.  The cron job can be
deleted using the command crontab -e

If you have more than one HDHomerun device on your network, want to use a tuner
other than /tuner0/ or have hdhomerun_config installed in a different
location than normal, you will need to take some additional steps to get this
program to work.  Options must be added to the end of the cron job line using
the command crontab -e
The program accepts the following options:

-p Path to hdhomerun_config (used to scan the tuner).
   Defaults to /usr/bin/hdhomerun_config
-t Which tuner to use (applicable only to multi-tuner models).
   Defaults to /tuner0/
-x Tuner ID.  Only needed if you have more than one HDHomeRun on your network.
   Defaults to FFFFFFFF

If you want to see what the program is doing in real time, stop the cron job,
open a terminal window and run ~/tvdx/scan_tuner -d
The -d option will print debugging information to the screen as the program
runs.
