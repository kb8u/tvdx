SDR Console can be controlled by other programs via serial port.  You will
probably need to configure a virtual serial port to be used by SDR Console
and this program.

See http://m3ghe.blogspot.com/p/connecting-external-program-suchas.html
for an example.

https://www.sdr-radio.com/cw-skimmer#VirtualSerialCable has another example.

The serial port to use is set in SDR Console in Tools->Options under
the Controllers->Cat (Serial Port) section
