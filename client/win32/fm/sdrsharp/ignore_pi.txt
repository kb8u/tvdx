# Example ignore file.  Format is frequency,PI code (no spaces at beginning or end of line).
# Lines incorrectly formatted are ignored silently. One entry per line.
# Here, if the # was removed from each line, both PI codes D12E and A32C would be ignored on 101.1 MHz
#101.1,D12E
#101.1,A32C
# Here, if the # was removed from the next line, 72AA would be ignored on 91.7 MHz
#91.7,72AA
